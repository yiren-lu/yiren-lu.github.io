I am a senior year undergraduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am enrolling in Quantum Computation & Algorithm Theory Lab in Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), CAS, as a master candidate.

I have rich experience in programming contests, therefore I'm highly skilled in coding and I'm quite familiar with many algorithms and data structures. I have participated in several ICPC onsite contests and other contests where I have won several awards. Besides participation, I have also designed many problems for several important programming contests, most of which are math-based.

Though I have studied in a school known for cultivate engineering talents, I still have a dream of being a theorist who works at a abstract, mathematics level. In my foreseeable years ahead, I will be putting effort to the area of quantum algorithm design and analysis.

This site contains some programming projects and slides for talks finished during my bachelor years, along with some blog posts on my study and life, and hopefully, items of publications in the near future.
